    <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <br>
            It defines the meaning and structure of web content.

    <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. <br>
            CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</dd>
    <dt>JavaScript</dt>

    <dt>Node. Js</dt>
        <dd>Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. <br>
            Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. 
            Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting</dd>
    <dt>Express. Js</dt>
        <dd>Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. <br>
            It is designed for building web applications and APIs. 
            It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js</dd>
    <dt>Mongo DB</dt>
        <dd>MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. <br>
            Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas</dd>
    <dt>React</dt>
        <dd>React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.<br>
             It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. <br>
            React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js</dd>
